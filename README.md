# 💡 **The Aligned Memory Battle: `std::aligned_alloc()` vs `aligned_malloc()`**

## ⚡ **Benchmarking Memory Alignment in C++**

### 🔍 **Introduction**
Memory alignment plays a **crucial role** in optimizing CPU performance, reducing cache misses, and improving SIMD operations. In C++17, `std::aligned_alloc()` was introduced to simplify memory alignment, but **is it really the best choice?**  

This article presents a **detailed benchmark** comparing `std::aligned_alloc()` and a manually implemented `aligned_malloc()`. We answer the following questions:

- **Is `std::aligned_alloc()` always the fastest option?**  
- **Can manual memory management outperform the standard implementation?**  
- **How do different memory sizes affect performance?**

## 📊 **Benchmark Results**
| Allocation Size | `std::aligned_alloc()` | `aligned_malloc()` | 🏆 Winner |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------|
| 64B           | **2415 us** | **3802 us** | `std::aligned_alloc()` ✅ |
| 128B          | **5622 us** | **3164 us** | `aligned_malloc()` ✅ |
| 256B          | **5132 us** | **2661 us** | `aligned_malloc()` ✅ |
| 1024B         | **14608 us** | **6369 us** | `aligned_malloc()` ✅ |
| 1MB           | **141 us** | **38 us** | `aligned_malloc()` ✅ |

### **📌 Key Takeaways**
- `std::aligned_alloc()` is **only faster for ultra-small allocations (64B)** due to optimized heap management.
- `aligned_malloc()` is **more efficient for allocations larger than 64B**, avoiding unnecessary libc allocator overhead.
- For **very large allocations (1MB+), `aligned_malloc()` is significantly faster** due to `mmap()` overhead in `std::aligned_alloc()`.

---

## 💡 **Understanding the Benchmark Results**
### **1. Why is `std::aligned_alloc()` faster for 64B but slower for larger sizes?**
- `std::aligned_alloc()` handles **very small blocks** more efficiently inside the heap.
- At **128B and 256B**, it likely introduces **internal alignment overhead**, making it slower.
- `aligned_malloc()` avoids this extra management and remains **faster for 128B+ allocations**.

### **2. Why is `std::aligned_alloc()` much slower for 1024B and 1MB?**
- **For allocations >1KB, `std::aligned_alloc()` starts using `mmap()`** instead of `malloc()`.
- `mmap()` involves **syscalls to the kernel**, significantly increasing allocation time.
- `aligned_malloc()` keeps using `malloc()`, avoiding the overhead.

### **3. Why is `aligned_malloc()` so much faster at 1MB?**
- `std::aligned_alloc()` is likely calling `mmap()`, introducing syscall overhead.
- `aligned_malloc()` keeps working in the heap, making it **dramatically faster (141 us vs. 38 us)**.
- **But caution**: `mmap()` is **slower in allocation but better for long-term memory use**.

🛠 **Test if `std::aligned_alloc()` uses `mmap()` with:**
```bash
strace ./bc 2>&1 | grep mmap
```
If it prints `mmap()` calls, that explains the performance drop.

## 🛠 **How Each Method Works**
### 🏆 **Method 1: `std::aligned_alloc()` (C++17)**
```cpp
void* ptr = std::aligned_alloc(64, 1024); // 64-byte alignment, 1024-byte allocation
std::free(ptr);
```
✅ **Pros:** Simpler, safer, and standard-compliant.  
❌ **Cons:** May be slower for very large or very small allocations.  

---

### 🏴‍☠️ **Method 2: `aligned_malloc()` (Manual `malloc()` Implementation)**
```cpp
void* aligned_malloc(size_t size, size_t alignment) {
    void* raw_mem = malloc(size + alignment + sizeof(void*));
    if (!raw_mem) return nullptr;
    
    uintptr_t aligned_addr = (reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(raw_mem) + alignment + sizeof(void*)) & ~(alignment - 1);
    reinterpret_cast<void**>(aligned_addr)[-1] = raw_mem;
    
    return reinterpret_cast<void*>(aligned_addr);
}

void aligned_free(void* aligned_mem) {
    if (aligned_mem) {
        free(reinterpret_cast<void**>(aligned_mem)[-1]);
    }
}
```
✅ **Pros:** Faster for allocations larger than 64B.  
❌ **Cons:** Requires manual memory management (**potential `segfault` if misused**).  

---

## 👌 **Final Thoughts**
1️⃣ **For ultra-small allocations (64B), `std::aligned_alloc()` is better.**  
2️⃣ **For anything larger than 64B, `aligned_malloc()` is consistently faster.**  
3️⃣ **For frequent allocations & deallocations, `aligned_malloc()` is more efficient.**  
4️⃣ **For very large memory (1MB+), `aligned_malloc()` dominates due to `mmap()` overhead in `std::aligned_alloc()`.**

# 🧐 Explanation


# 🏴‍☠️ mmap() vs. malloc(): The Dark Magic of Memory Allocation ⚡

## 1️⃣ Why is `mmap()` Slower in Allocation?
🔹 **Because `mmap()` makes a system call to the kernel.**  

When you use `mmap()` to allocate memory, it requests memory **directly from the operating system**. This means it has to go through the **kernel**, which involves a **context switch**, adding overhead.  

### **How `mmap()` Works in Allocation:**
1. The request is sent to the OS via a syscall.  
2. The OS checks the page table and assigns virtual memory pages.  
3. The memory is mapped to the process, but it’s **not actually allocated in RAM yet**.  
4. On the first access, the OS assigns a **physical page** (page fault).  

### **Why `mmap()` is slower:**
✅ **Syscalls add latency** (switching between user-space and kernel-space).  
✅ **Virtual memory pages are lazy-loaded** (not fully allocated until first access).  

---

### **How `malloc()` Works in Allocation:**
1. `malloc()` typically gets memory **from the heap**, which is already reserved by the process.  
2. If the heap needs more memory, `malloc()` **might call `sbrk()`** (which expands the heap).  
3. If the request is very large, `malloc()` **might use `mmap()` internally** (but only for large allocations).  

Since **`malloc()` just hands out memory from the heap (which is already managed by the process)**, it’s **faster** than calling `mmap()` directly.

---

## 2️⃣ Why is `mmap()` Better for Long-Term Use?
🔹 **Because it avoids heap fragmentation and allows fine-grained memory control.**  

When you allocate memory with `malloc()`, that memory comes from the **heap**. The problem is that **`malloc()` cannot release memory back to the OS until the entire heap segment is freed**.

### **Heap Fragmentation Problem:**
- If you frequently allocate and free different-sized blocks, **holes appear in the heap**.  
- These holes cause **fragmentation**, making future allocations inefficient.  
- Even if memory is freed, the OS **cannot reclaim it** if it’s inside an active heap segment.  

### **Why `mmap()` Avoids This Problem:**
- Each `mmap()` call **allocates a separate memory region**.  
- When you free an `mmap()` allocation, the OS **immediately reclaims the memory**.  
- This is **great for large, long-lived allocations** (like buffers that last the whole program).  

✅ **If you have memory that will live for a long time, `mmap()` prevents heap fragmentation.**  
✅ **If you allocate and free memory frequently, `malloc()` might cause fragmentation, while `mmap()` can avoid it.**

## 3️⃣ When to Use `mmap()` vs. `malloc()`?

| **Scenario**                  | **Use `malloc()` ✅** | **Use `mmap()` ✅** |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Small allocations (< 1MB)**  | ✅ Faster & efficient | ❌ Overhead too high |
| **Frequent allocations/deallocations** | ✅ Avoids syscall overhead | ❌ Can be slow due to syscalls |
| **Large allocations (> 1MB)**  | ❌ May cause heap fragmentation | ✅ OS handles memory better |
| **Memory that lives for a long time** | ❌ Might fragment the heap | ✅ OS can reclaim it easily |

---

## 🔥 **Summary**
- **Use `malloc()` for small, short-lived allocations** (faster, avoids syscall overhead).  
- **Use `mmap()` for large, long-lived allocations** (avoids fragmentation, gives fine control).  
- **If you allocate and free large memory chunks frequently, consider `mmap()` to reduce fragmentation.**  

---

## 🚀 **The Real Battle: `mmap()` vs. `malloc()`**
- **If your program needs ultra-fast memory allocation/deallocation, use `malloc()`.**  
- **If you need efficient, long-term memory usage with minimal fragmentation, use `mmap()`.**  

🔥 **Now you know the dark magic behind memory allocation!** 🏴‍☠️⚡
